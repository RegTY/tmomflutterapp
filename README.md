# TMOM Flutter App

A temperature sensing app in conjunction with a temperature sensing device.

## Getting Started
This project aims to create a non-contact temperature device that can be powered and used via a phone or alternatively any USB powered source. By utilizing it with a phone, it allows for more features that are provided by the app such as text to speech feature, or automatic logging to google form.
